About MIMU
============

MIMI (Molecular Isotope Mass Identifier) is a command-line tool to identify molecular formulas for chemical compounds present in complex samples using data from Ultra High Resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (UHR-FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS). 

To accelerate and streamline the analysis of complex mixtures of small molecules -- such as metabolite 
samples for environmental, biological, or paleontological studies -- MIMI compares the measured masses of peaks in mass spectra against precomputed theoretical masses for a defined set of compounds. MIMI supports both data from publicly available molecular databases and custom lists, and it accommodates samples composed of natural and/or user-specified atomic isotope ratios.

Key Features
------------
- **Advanced Mass Analysis**: Processes UHR-FT-ICR mass spectrometry data with high precision
- **Isotope Aware**: Supports both natural and user-defined isotope-labeled samples
- **Flexible Ionization**: Supports multiple ionization modes (positive, negative)
- **Efficient Caching**: Pre-computes theoretical molecular masses for specified compound lists
- **Fine-Structure Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes molecular isotopic fine-structure patterns
- **Precise Matching**: Detects matching masses with sub-parts per million (PPM) resolution
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple samples efficiently
- **Database Integration**: Supports auto-generation of compound lists from HMDB and KEGG databases
- **Customizable Isotope Ratios**: Easily accommodates different user-defined isotopic labeling ratios
- **Command-line Utility**: Simple command-line interface for rapid characterization of complex mixtures
