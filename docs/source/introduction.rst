About MIMI
----------
MIMI (Molecular Isotope Mass Identifier) is a command-line tool designed to identify molecules 
present in complex samples using data from Ultra High Resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron 
Resonance (UHR-FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. 
Developed by the `CGSB Lab <https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/nyuad-cgsb.html>`_ at `New York University Abu Dhabi <http://nyuad.nyu.edu/>`_, 
MIMI accelerates and streamlines the analysis of complex mixtures of small molecules, such as metabolite 
samples for environmental, biological, or paleontological studies. It compares measured data against both 
standard and customized molecular databases and accommodates natural or user-specified isotope ratios.
