About MIMI
---------
MIMI (Molecular Isotope Mass Identifier) is a specialized mass spectrometric data analysis tool developed by the `CGSB Lab <https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/nyuad-cgsb.html>`_ at `New York University Abu Dhabi <http://nyuad.nyu.edu/>`_. It is specifically designed for processing isotope-labeled FT-ICR (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance) mass spectrometry data.

Key Features
